    bio: [
      "A curious builder and Product Manager with 4+ years of experience taking products from 0 → 1 across B2B and B2C. I’ve shipped and scaled global platforms at Nielsen, led HRTech SaaS at Altimetrik, and previously co-founded a short-video startup.",
      "I like working where ambiguity is high and the feedback loops are fast — talking to users, analysing data, and turning messy problems into simple, elegant workflows."

    current: "Lately, I'm learning LangGraph and building AI Agents to reduce operational noise, improve decisions, and unlock new product experiences.",
