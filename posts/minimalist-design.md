# The Art of Minimalist Design

Minimalism isn't just about removing things; it's about adding the right things.

## Why it matters

In a world full of noise, clarity is a superpower. When you reduce visual clutter, you guide the user's attention to what truly matters: the content.

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

### Key Principles

1.  **Whitespace**: It allows elements to breathe.
2.  **Typography**: The voice of your design.
3.  **Color**: Use it sparingly to highlight importance.
